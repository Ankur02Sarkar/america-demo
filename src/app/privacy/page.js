                    <li>Legitimate interests: the processing is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party, unless there is a good reason to protect your Personal Data which overrides those legitimate interests.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Security of your Personal Data</h2>

                <h2>Data processing on our website</h2>

                <h3>a) Use of cookies</h3>
                <p>We think it's important that you have full control over your privacy online. That's why we refrained from placing cookies that are not strictly necessary as such no requirement to obtain consent exists. Please keep in mind that this approach may change and that our approach to cookies may be revised or that it becomes necessary to use a certain cookie to ensure the full functionality and security of our website.</p>

                <h3>b) $USD Purchases</h3>
                <p>To make a purchase, you may need to connect a valid wallet account MetaMask. We would like to point out that we are not responsible for any processing of personal data when connecting your crypto wallet.</p>

                <h2>Controls For Do-Not-Track Features</h2>
                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized.</p>
                <p>As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.</p>

                <h2>Do Not Sell</h2>
                <p>We do not sell data to third parties.</p>

                <h2>Changes</h2>
                <p>Because we’re always looking for new and innovative ways to improve our website and services, this policy may change over time. We will notify you before any material changes take effect so that you have time to review the changes.</p>
