          There comes a time in every degen's life when you have to make a
          choice.{" "}

        <p>Forget the blue pill. Forget the red pill. You're taking both. </p>
        <p>Placebo is for the weak minded and you're a warrior. </p>
        <p>
          Ready to burn the boats and start something that can only be finished.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>They've printed, imported, outsourced and taxed. </p>
        <p>They've lied, frauded, manipulated and colluded. </p>
        <p>It's time to take back what is ours. What is yours. </p>
        <p>The sheep will follow and the wolves will starve. </p>

        <p>We are liberty. We are sovereignty. </p>
        <p>The destroyers of a corrupt currency. </p>
        <p>The bringers of a new dawn. </p>
        <p>
          People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should
          be afraid of their people.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>So let them fear you. </p>
        <p>Let them see you. </p>
        <p>Let them understand your might. </p>
        <p>And let them all become believers. </p>

        <p>We are the shadow of the mass. </p>
        <p>We are the bump in the night of the elites. </p>
        <p>There will be blood on our swords. </p>
        <p>But none on our hands. </p>

        <p>So wake up.</p>
        <p>And let the real flippening begin.</p>
